## Description

This is a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with a couple of exceptions. See more about this in my Specificiations. 

## Installation / Setup

Go to the week3 folder from your Terminal

Type in open index.html from your Terminal 
  this will open my "robot" in an HTML browser

Enjoy my beep-boop robot!

## Specifications

The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number

* Input: "4"
* Output: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4"

Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"

* Input: “1”
* Output: “Beep”

Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"

* Input: “1, 2”
* Output: “Boop"

Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry. I don't do threes! ^_^"

* Input: "1, 2, 3"
* Output: "I'm sorry. I don't do threes! ^_^"

These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third.

Examples:

The number 13 should be replaced with:
* "I'm sorry. I don't do threes! ^_^"

The number 21 should be replaced with:
* "Boop".

The number 32 should be replaced with:
* "I'm sorry. I don't do threes! ^_^"
